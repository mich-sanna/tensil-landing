  Tensil is going open-source
---

We're excited to announce Tensil v1.0.0 is released! To try it out, go to the [docs]({{< relref "/docs" >}}). If you like what we're doing, please give us a star on [Github](https://github.com/tensil-ai/tensil). Please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TSw34H3PXr) to
say hello or ask a question.

If you're wondering who we are and what we're doing, here's some information from our [About]({{< relref "/about" >}}) page:

> We design free and open source machine learning accelerators that anyone can
use. Custom silicon for <abbr title="Machine Learning" class="initialism">ML</abbr> is already used by massive
companies like Google,
Facebook and Tesla, but everyone else has been left out. Small and mid-sized
companies, students and academics, hobbyists and tinkerers all currently have no
chance of getting ML accelerators customized for their needs. We aim to change
that, starting with ML inference on edge <abbr title="Field Programmable Gate Array" class="initialism">FPGA</abbr>
platforms. Our dream is that our
accelerators help those people make new applications possible that simply
weren't feasible before.

We're looking forward to seeing what you do with Tensil!
