<h1>Our philosophy</h1>
<p class="lead">We believe that advances in artificial intelligence go hand in hand with advances in computing hardware.
  The key ideas for deep learning are over seventy years old, yet only in the last decade have we been successfully
  using them to solve problems with human-level performance. What changed? General purpose <abbr
    title="Graphics Programming Unit" class="initialism">GPU</abbr>s were developed for
  accelerating graphical applications, and some plucky researchers realized they could use them to train neural
  networks too. Given the terminal decline of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's Law</a>, we
  think the next wave of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence" class="initialism">AI</abbr> innovation will be unlocked
  by accelerators designed specifically for machine learning.

    "Improvements in compute have been a key component of AI progress... within many current domains, more compute seems
    to lead predictably to better performance, and is often complementary to algorithmic advances."

<h1>What we do</h1>

<p class="lead">
  We design free and open source machine learning accelerators that anyone can
  use. Custom silicon for <abbr title="Machine Learning" class="initialism">ML</abbr> is already used by massive
  companies like Google,
  Facebook and Tesla, but everyone else has been left out. Small and mid-sized
  companies, students and academics, hobbyists and tinkerers all currently have no
  chance of getting ML accelerators customized for their needs. We aim to change
  that, starting with ML inference on edge <abbr title="Field Programmable Gate Array" class="initialism">FPGA</abbr>
  platforms. Our dream is that our
  accelerators help those people make new applications possible that simply
  weren't feasible before.

<h1>Why open source?</h1>

<p class="lead">
  Open source software has revolutionized the world. The device you're using to read this almost certainly makes use
  of dozens if not hundreds of <abbr title="Open Source Software" class="initialism">OSS</abbr> projects. Open source
  has been so influential because it gives end
  users to understand how their software works, to make changes as they see fit, and to participate in further
  development. This creates a virtuous cycle of feedback and improvement that benefits everyone.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  Until recently, open source silicon was little more than a
  beautiful idea,
  but the rapid rise of <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a>, backed by
  companies like <a href="https://www.sifive.com">SiFive</a>, has provided an example of how it can be done. We aim to
  emulate their approach to replicate their impact. With momentum building, organizations like the <a
    href="https://www.fossi-foundation.org/">FOSSi Foundation</a> have emerged
  to coalesce and guide open source silicon development. Major corporate players like Intel and Google are also buying
  in to the idea
  by providing sponsorships and resources to stimulate progress. We believe that now is a great time to get
  involved with this movement, and we hope to do our part by bringing the benefits of open source silicon to the people
  working
  on AI.

<h1>How will Tensil make money?</h1>

<p class="lead">
  Despite the benefits of open source development, many open source projects have often struggled to become
  self-sustaining. A typical
  case
  is that a project with thousands or even millions of users may only have a handful of core developers making the
  lion's share
  of contributions. Without a funding source, those developers may be forced to shift their time and effort to other
  activities
  in which it's easier to get paid. This problem has inspired <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software">many, many attempts to solve it</a>,
  but in the last decade there have been dozens of notable successes such as MySQL, Red Hat and GitLab. Those projects
  have typically used a combination of dual licensing (community and enterprise editions), cloud-based managed offerings
  and engineering services.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  Open source silicon will require different mechanisms to respond to different dynamics, but we believe there is a lot
  to draw on for inspiration from those commercial OSS trailblazers. You can find out more about our commercialization
  plans
  in our <a href="{{< relref "/docs/roadmap" >}}">Roadmap</a>. However, no matter what paid products or services we may
  introduce, all our open source projects will always remain open source, and we commit to supporting and maintaining
  them
  as long as there are still people who want to be involved in them.
